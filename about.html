	<h2> <b> Who we are? </b></h2>
	Diversity and equal opportunity regardless of ethnicity, religion,
	and background, are at the heart of who we are, how we think, and operate.
	Enchanting Travels was started in 2004 with one purpose - to redefine 
	transformational and authentic travel around the world through our 
	destination expertise, local presence and support, and a passionate 
	team who genuinely care.
	</p>
	<p>
	Today, we are proud to have created a truly multicultural company 
	with people from diverse backgrounds at every level, right from our 
	leadership team which is represented by a group of eight people from 
	five nationalities to our larger global management team of 22 people 
	from equally diverse national and cultural backgrounds.
	Across our company, we are split almost evenly between outstanding men 
	and women from 19 nationalities working in 12 countries around the world.
	What unites us is our true passion for travel.
	</p>
	<p>
	The world has changed since we began our journey, but our mission 
	has remained the same - we enrich lives by sharing the joy of personalized 
	travel in a passionate, ethical, and genuine way. 
	We believe that travel opens our hearts and minds, allows us to 
	engage with different cultures from around the world, and find beauty 
	in this diversity.
	Through the way we operate and the journeys we plan, 
	we hope to bring humanity together by sharing this incredible joy of travel.
